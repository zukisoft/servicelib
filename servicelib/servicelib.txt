PARAMETERS
----------

Support for basic read-only registry-based service parameters is provided by the following
data types that can be declared for service-local member variables:

DWordParameter (uint32_t)
- Registry type: REG_BINARY or REG_DWORD

MultiStringParameter (std::vector<svctl::tstring>)
- Registry type: REG_MULTI_SZ

QWordParameter (uint64_t)
- Registry type: REG_BINARY or REG_QWORD

StringParameter (svctl::tstring)
- Registry type: REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ

BinaryParameter<T> (T)
- Registry type: REG_BINARY
- T must be a trivial data type, see std::is_trivial() for a definition of what qualifies

Declare the parameter(s) as member variable(s) in the service class, optionally
specifying a default value.  If no default value is set at construction, the value
will either be set to zero (DWordParameter, QWordParameter, BinaryParameter<T>), an
empty string (StringParameter) or an empty vector<> (MultiStringParameter):

	private:
		...
		StringParameter m_mysz { _T("defaultvalue") };
		DWordParameter m_mydword;

In order for the service to locate and bind each parameter, they must be exposed via
the BEGIN_PARAMETER_MAP() set of macros, similar to how control handlers are exposed.
Static constant parameter value names can be used, as can resource string identifiers
provided that the string table is part of the local executable's resources:

	BEGIN_PARAMETER_MAP(MyService)
		PARAMETER_ENTRY(IDS_MYSZ_NAME, m_mysz)
		PARAMETER_ENTRY(_T("MyDWORDParameter"), m_mydword)
	END_PARAMETER_MAP()

At service startup, the PARAMETER_MAP is iterated and each parameter is bound to the 
HLKM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\{service name}\Parameters registry key.  If this
parent key does not exist, it will be created automatically.  Each parameter will then
be loaded from the parameters key using the name specified in the PARAMETER_MAP.

If any parameters exist in the PARAMETER_MAP, the service will also automatically accept
the SERVICE_CONTROL_PARAMCHANGE control, and will reload each bound parameter in response
to this service control *before* it is passed onto the service class itself.  This makes
it unnecessary for the service to declare a custom handler if no other meaningful work
needs to be done in response to SERVICE_CONTROL_PARAMCHANGE.

Parameter instances are intended to be used as cached read-only values that can be
copied into local variables as needed, they should not be used directly.  A *copy* of the
underlying value are returned each time a parameter is accessed, this behavior should be 
kept in mind, especially for the MultiStringParameter and BinaryParameter<T> versions, as
they potentially store a great deal of data.  This behavior is enforced to allow the parameters
to be thread-safe with the SERVICE_CONTROL_PARAMCHANGE automatic handler.

Correct way to declare and access parameters:

	BEGIN_PARAMETER_MAP(MyService)
		PARAMETER_ENTRY(_T("RetryCount"), m_retrycount)
		PARAMETER_ENTRY(_T("TempDirectory"), m_tempdir)
	END_PARAMETER_MAP()

	DWordParameter m_retrycount = 10;
	StringParameter m_tempdir;

	void OnStart(DWORD argc, LPTSTR* argv)
	{
		svctl::tstring tempdir = m_tempdir;	
		CreateTempDirectoryToHoldInterestingStuff(tempdir);
		...		
		uint32_t retrycount = m_retrycount;
		while(--retrycount) { 
			...
		}
	}

Parameters can be manually reloaded from the registry by invoking the Load method, although
if the parameter was not successfully bound to the service's Parameters registry key, this
method will do nothing.  Detection of a successful load from the registry can be accomplished
by checking the IsDefaulted property of the parameter variable.  This will be set to false once
the value has been loaded from the registry at least once
